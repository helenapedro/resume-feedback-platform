  Database constraints
    are rules enforcing data integrity, accuracy, and reliability in a database
    by limiting the type of data that can be inserted, updated, or deleted in tables,
    preventing invalid entries and ensuring consistency with business logic, using types
    like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK. These rules, applied at column
    or table level, are crucial for maintaining data quality and preventing errors like duplicates or orphaned records.
